# Pretty formats squash consecutive blocks and write them from a background thread. When that write
# fails (here: the reader of the pipe has exited), the error has to reach the query. Otherwise the
# query never learns that nobody reads its output and keeps running - this one would run forever.

# `output_format_pretty_max_rows` is raised so that every block is written, and the query keeps
# writing into the broken pipe. `output_format_pretty_squash_consecutive_ms` is pinned because the
# background writer is only used when it is non-zero. `timeout` exits with 124 if the query hangs.
# The query has to fail with the original write error, `CANNOT_WRITE_TO_FILE_DESCRIPTOR` (exit code 75),
# not with `QUERY_WAS_CANCELLED` or anything else.

# raised so that the server sends progress packets rarely: the client has to notice the error while it
# polls the connection, not only when it processes a packet. It is not raised further, because the
# server also checks for the `Cancel` packet only that often. The client has to cancel the query on the
